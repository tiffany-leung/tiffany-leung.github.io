We had all kinds of food from this table - pizza, red velvet cupcakes, japchae and we even made macarons on this very table (even though we did fail miserably). These meals were topped off with epic sing-alongs to 80s music, and we can also never forget those mornings when we soothe our hangovers with maple syrup/nutella drizzled on waffles.</span>
