  	<span class="popuptext7" id="myPopup7"> What happened in this room included a lot of crying, laughing, doing planks, cleaning up blood, quite a bit of nudity and of course a lot of drunken nights. We could not count how many times we have at least messed up in something when we decided to sleep over in this room, till the point when I believed it was curse just to sleepover in that room. It was sometimes too cold and sometimes too hot; it was not a perfect place to sleep, especially when sleeping on the floor, but it was a hell of a place to make memories. </span>
