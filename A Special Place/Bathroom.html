  	<span class="popuptext8" id="myPopup8"> Seems like a normal bathroom at first, where people answer the call of nature and shower. However, for us, this place is a little different. Though it is not haunted, this is also where I (Tiffany), managed to shatter the glass door of the showering area, just by opening it. Even though this happened to me, it was traumatizing to all of us. The floor was covered in shattered glass and stained with drops of blood. For some reason, I was brave enough to step on the glass to get out of the bathroom, but it ended up with my friends picking out bits and pieces of glass stuck on the bottom of my feet, as well as cleaning up the glass mess. We will never forget that day.   </span>
