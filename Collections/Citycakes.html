        <p> I have never been to City Cakes - I usually just walked passed it on my way to school.
            But I was told by my roommates that they have the best cookies and cupcakes, and they
            managed to surprise me with a giant chocolate lava cookie one day. City Cakes is the place where
            we usually get cupcakes for each other's birthdays or to cheer up whoever is having a rough day. </p>

            Located in Chelsea, this bakery is actually pretty card to find. It is nestled in the basement
            of a brownstone building on 18th street, so you may not see it if you don't look carefully. However,
            the fact that it is in the basement, gives it a sense of cosiness, especially for a bakery that embraces
            you with the aroma of freshly made cake and frosting.
