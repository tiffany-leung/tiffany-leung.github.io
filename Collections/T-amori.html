        <p> I was on a search to find a good, yet affordable place to do eyelash extensions in New York,
            when my friend recommended me to this salon called T-amori. I went honestly for the first-comer's
            $30 discount, but I was then pleasantly surprised by the salon environment itself. The service
            was impeccable - which included a one-on-one consultation on top of the eyelash extension service
            itself. </p>

            This place was a salon that was located in a pretty obscure area as well, despite being in the bustling street of 13th street
            and 3rd Avenue. It was at the basement level of a building, it was not easy to notice until you really try to find it
            (like I could not find the place the very first time).
