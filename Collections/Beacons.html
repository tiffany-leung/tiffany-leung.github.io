        <p> This was the first ever thrift store I have been to in NYC. There is one located
            conveniently right next to the Parsons building and I always saw people walking around
            with a shopping bag from that store - so I decided to check it out. In my freshman year,
            I was in utter awe at how many unique pieces of clothing I can find in this shop; there
            were one-of-a-kind, vintage and branded pieces that were a steal based on their marked prices.
            You have no idea how much money I have spent in there.</p>

            I have to say that the place Beacon's Closet decided to locate one of its branches is
            indeed a genius one. Right at the corner of the Parsons building, attracting fashion forward
            students from the school to wander in and shop during their free time, or even breaks between classes.
            I have also been to the one in Williamsburg, where it is massive and quite overwhelming - location
            is also pretty genius as it is in the heart of where young hipsters would frequent.</span>
