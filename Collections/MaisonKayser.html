        <p> My friends and I came to this cafe when we were all in need of a coffee,
            after a long day of walking around Central Park. The front of the cafe is a bakery
            where people can purchase their French pastries on the go, but if you had time like us and would
            like to sit down, have a drink and a chat, the cafe area is a perfect place to do so. Honestly,
            the drinks and pastries here were a bit pricey, so I opted for a tea instead, when I really wanted
            a cold chocolate drink. I have never tried the pastries before as I was on a budget, but I would
            definitely want to try that out some day.</p>

            There are so many branches for Maison Kayser, but I really like the one in Greenwhich Village.
            It is nice and quiet there with minimal traffic, and a warm cup of tea/coffee, croissant and a book would
            make a perfect stay-in day.
            The branches I've shown here are only the ones Downtown, but there is plenty more of them Uptown.
