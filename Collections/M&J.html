        <p> I didn't come here on my own accord - I came here because the fashion
            designer I was interning for needed transparent plastic snap buttons.
            The service was pretty subpar to be honest, as the retail assistants
            talked to me as if I am stupid and insignificant. Well, the place was
            pretty nice, with all kinds of buttons and borders one may need for garment
            making. But will I ever go back there? Probably no. </p>

            A garment accessory retail store is of course found in New York's Garment district.
            To be completely honest, this is the part of New York that I do not enjoy. The smell, the noise,
            and the traffic is insane. It only gets better when one walks uptown towards Bryant park and out of
            that area.
