        <p> Macarons are my favourite patisserie, therefore Laduree always hits the sweet spot in me.
            The first Laduree shop I've been to was a tiny boutique back in Singapore. However small it was,
            the decor and shop layout never failed to impress me, and it's outstanding store decor lured
            me into buying a pricey macaron or 2. When I came to NYC and heard about this cafe, I had to visit it.
            My first experience with this cafe was magical - a nice warm weather as winter transitioned into spring;
            my friend and I sat at the outdoor patio sipping our tea and eating our desserts as flower petals drifted down
            from the trees, covering the concrete floor with spots of lilac. To top it all off, a beautiful French waiter
            came up to us and offered us complimentary macarons. </p>

            If you want to get the full Laduree cafe experience, I would recommend going to the one in SoHo.
            The store in the Upper East Side is also no doubt, absolutely stunning, but it is a little small and stuffy
            for a dining experience. Remember to either go during the weekdays or the non-peak hours during the weekends - This
            place is so popular, you may have to wait up to 45 mins for a table. </span>
