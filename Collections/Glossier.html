        <p> It was my suitemate who told me about the Glossier shop in NYC. I didn't know what this brand
            was about until she introduced me to a skincare serum in freshman year. She came back with the
            serum and I was instantly drawn to its packaging; then I thought "I really needed to go there."
            One day when I had nothing else to do, I hopped onto the Subway to Canal street to find the Glossier store.
            It's location is so obscure, that it needed somebody to sit by the building's entrance and tell you which floor to get
            off at for the store. Once the elevator doors open, I was welcomed by a pink, brightly lit room, with their
            Glossier products displayed on their respective counters. I love the atmosphere it gives just by the display and use
            of mirrors to give a sense of space. </p>

            This shop is hidden in a very obscure place - it is on the Penthouse floor of a sad,
            grey industrial building on Canal street. It was so hidden that they needed a sales assistant to sit
            by the entrance of the building, on top of that Glossier sign that was placed outside.
