        <p> Foragers is the convenient supermarket right around the corner when I needed
            to get last minute groceries. Just a few minutes away from where I stay, I usually
            go there to get an emergency avocado, piping-hot ready made food whenever I am too
            lazy to cook a meal or get boujee "healthier" snacks when I want something to munch on.
            The prices of the products here may not be the most ideal (they can sell up to $10 for a bar of chocolate),
            but I really just go there when I want a healthier food option, without having to walk too far away
            from my living accomodations.

            Foragers is nestled in the neighbourhood of Chelsea, on 8th Avenue
            and 22nd Street. Besides being an upscale gorcery store, it is also
            a cafe (for coffee and muffins) and also a restaurant for full meals.
            Despite its upscale pricing, it IS in Chelsea, so there has to be a place
            where people can get their muffins and food made from organic produce.
