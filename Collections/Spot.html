      <p> We found this dessert bar through google search -
      my friends and I were all craving something sweet after a long day. However,
      we faced the problem of having one of us being allergic to gluten, so we had to find
      a place that served gluten free desserts. It was such a popular place, we had to wait outside for a long time
      in the rather chilly weather of the early fall. I absolutely enjoyed my experience there, especially
      the different kinds of desserts they served, despite the ongoing headache I had that day.
      I would definitely go back for that dream-like matcha lava cake. </p>

          This Asian-American dessert bar is located in the heart of the bustling St. Mark's Place, the night
          life hot spot for a lot of college kids living in the area. Surrounded by a bunch of Japanese restaurants, karaoke bars,
        and smoke shops, this dessert bar attracts whoever is having a sweet tooth after dinner. Given that this area is indeed
        a hot spot, do not be alarmed by the waiting lines you need to get through - it is pretty expected for a place like this. </span>
