        <p> The first time I went to the Milkbar was with a whole bunch of friends, who
            apparently have a sudden craving for ice cream on a cold winter day. We walked all the way
            to the Milkbar branch on the Lower East Side, and despite the constant raving and praise
            for the desserts here, I did not give anything a try because of my sore throat. It was not
            until later when I found out that there was a Milkbar 2 minutes away from where I stayed; I tried
            the Cereal Milk ice cream and it changed my life. This ice cream is honestly not everyone's cup of
            tea, as there are people I know that don't like it - but they really still have to try out the
            Crack Pie before they make their final judgement. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="Milkbar-location">
        <div class="Milkbarpopup" onclick="myFunction3()"> Milkbar
          <span class="Milkbarpopuptext" id="Milkbar-Popup">
            Ever since I found out that there is a branch right next to where I live, the Milkbar in Chelsea is the one
            I normally frequent whenever I want dessert. I usually walk in with a Cereal Milk Soft Swirl in mind,
            but more often than not, I would end up finding myself caught between the ice cream and the Crack Pie. </span>

        <img id="MB-Chelsea" src="Milkbar-Chelsea.png">
        <div class="Milkbar2popup" onclick="myFunction4()"> Milkbar
          <span class="Milkbar2popuptext" id="Milkbar2-Popup">
            Of course, if you do not live around the area of Chelsea, you still have the chance to find
            your nearest Milkbar to enjoy. There are branches all across Manhattan and one in Brooklyn;
            so if you live deep inside Brooklyn and want to have a taste of Milkbar, I'd say go all the way to Williamsburg
            or just wait for the next time you come to Manhattan.
