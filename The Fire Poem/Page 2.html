  <p><span class="change">All</span> this had given me <span class="change">nightmares</span> when I was child, and for months I <span class="change">used to wake screaming,</span> night after night. <span class="change">My mother</span>, usually <span class="change">the mildest</span> and most obedient of wives, had <span class="change">berated my father</span> for allowing her son to see such things<span class="change">.</span></p>

<p>‘Will they do it to me <span class="change">one day?</span>’ <span class="change">I</span> had <span class="change">asked</span> my mother.</p>

<p><span class="change">Night after night.</span></p>

<p>Now, on <span class="change">a summer morning</span> years later, I heard <span class="change">a ripple of song from a blackbird.</span> The bed creaked as <span class="change">my father</span> shifted his weight.</p> 
	<p>‘James?’ he said in <span class="change">the thin</span>, dry voice <span class="change">of his old age</span>. These days he <span class="change">slept badly</span> and rose early, complaining <span class="change">of bad dreams.</span> </p>
<p>'<span class="change">James? Are you awake yet?</span> Why’s it so hot? Let’s walk in the garden. It will be cooler there.’ </p>
