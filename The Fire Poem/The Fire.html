  <h1>Ignis</h1>
  <h2><em>part i</em></h2>
  <p>During the <span class="change">Fire </span>, I saw much that seemed <span class="change">against custom and nature,</span> against reason and divine ordinance, much that <span class="change"> seems to foreshadow</span> greater <span class="change">disasters yet to come.</span> <span class="change"><em>Monstra</em></span>, as the scholars <span class="change">called</span> such things, meaning <span class="change">wonders or prodigies or</span> evil <span class="change">omens.</span> <span class="change">The destruction</span> of St. Paul’s <span class="change">was one</span> of them<span class="change">.</span> </p>
  <p>But <span class="change">when</span> I fell asleep that <span class="change">night,</span> I did not <span class="change">dream of flames</span> and falling buildings. I dreamed of the boy- woman’s face <span class="change">and the wide-open, unfocused eyes.</span> </p>
<p><span class="change">Ashes and </span> blood. <span class="change">Night</span> after night<span class="change">.</span></p>
<p>I was thinking of ashes and blood when <span class="change">I woke</span> from a fitful sleep <span class="change">on the morning</span> after the Fire reached St. Paul’s. I knew <span class="change">by light</span> that it was early, <span class="change">not long after dawn.</span> </p>
<p>Not the <span class="change">hot ashes of the</span> city last night. Not the <span class="change">blood from my hand</span>, after the boy-girl had bitten me. </p>
<p>This blood had been <span class="change">dripping from a head.</span> <span class="change">As</span> for the <span class="change">ashes,</span> they had been cold. A <span class="change">weeping</span> man had rubbed them into his hair<span class="change">.</span></p>
