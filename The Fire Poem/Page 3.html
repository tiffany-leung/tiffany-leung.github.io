  <h1>Ignis</h1>
  <h2><em>part iii</em></h2>
  <p>Even here, on the outskirts of Chelsea, <span class="change">the sky</span> was grey <span class="change">with ash,</span> <span class="change">the rising sun</span> reduced to a smear <span class="change">of orange.</span> The air was spreading warm. <span class="change">It smelled of cinders.</span> </p>
	
<p> After <span class="change">I had dressed,</span> I <span class="change">removed</span> the bandage from my left hand. <span class="change">The bleeding</span> had stopped <span class="change">but</span> the wound <span class="change">throbbed</span> <span class="change">.</span> I rewrapped the bandage and helped my father <span class="change">down the narrow stairs</span>, hoping we would not wake the Ralstons. </p>

	<p> We walked <span class="change">in the orchard,</span> with my father leaning on my right arm. <span class="change">The trees were heavy</span> with fruit - apples, pears and <span class="change">plums mainly,</span> but also damsons, walnuts, <span class="change">and a medlar.</span> <span class="change">The dew was still</span> on the grass<span class="change">.</span> </p>
	
	<p>My father shuffled along. ‘Why is it so black?’</p>
	<p>'<span class="change">It’s the Fire, sir.</span> All the smoke.’</p>
	<p><span class="change">Frowning,</span> he turned his face up <span class="change">to the sky. ‘But it’s snowing.’ </span></p>
	<p><span class="change">The wind</span> had moderated a little overnight and had shifted <span class="change">from the east to the south.</span> The air was full of <span class="change">dark flakes, fluttering and turning like drunken dancers.</span> </p>
