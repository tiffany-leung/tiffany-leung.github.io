<div class="poem">
<p> ‘Is there anybody there?’ said the Traveller, </p>  
   <p> Knocking on the moonlit door;</p>
<p> And his horse in the silence champed the grasses</p>
   <p> Of the forest’s ferny floor:</p>
<p> And a bird flew up out of the turret, </p>  
   <p> Above the Traveller’s head:</p>
<p> And he smote upon the door again a second time;</p>   
   <p> ‘Is there anybody there?’ he said.</p>
<p> But no one descended to the Traveller;</p>   
   <p> No head from the leaf-fringed sill</p>
<p> Leaned over and looked into his grey eyes,</p>   
   <p> Where he stood perplexed and still.</p>
<p> But only a host of phantom listeners</p>  
   <p> That dwelt in the lone house then</p>
<p> Stood listening in the quiet of the moonlight</p>  
   <p> To that voice from the world of men:</p>
<p> Stood thronging the faint moonbeams on the dark stair,</p>   
   <p> That goes down to the empty hall,</p>
<p> Hearkening in an air stirred and shaken</p>   
   <p> By the lonely <a href="Page 3.html">Traveller’s call</a>.</p> 
<p> And he felt in his heart their strangeness,</p>   
   <p> Their stillness answering his cry,</p>
<p> While his horse moved, cropping the dark turf,</p>   
   <p> ’Neath the starred and leafy sky;</p>
<p> For he suddenly smote on the door, even</p>   
   <p> Louder, and lifted his head:—</p>
<p> ‘Tell them I came, and no one answered,</p>   
   <p> That I kept my word,’ he said.</p>
<p>    Though every word he spake</p>
<p>    From the one man left awake:</p>
<p> Ay, they heard his foot upon the stirrup,</p>   
   <p> And the sound of iron on stone,</p>
<p> And how the silence surged softly backward,</p>   
   <p> When the plunging hoofs were gone.</p>
