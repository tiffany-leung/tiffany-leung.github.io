  	<span class="sacpopuptext" id="myPopupsac"> The blue pinafore is the uniform symbol of a Catholic school. Most of the other all girls Catholic schools have dark blue pinafores, but for some reason, ours was a light ultramarine blue. The best part about this pinafore though, was the pocket on the right side - so practical and convenient.</span>

<button class="sacpopup1" onclick="sacFunction1()"> 
  	<span class="sacpopuptext1" id="myPopupsac1"> Underneath the pinafore was a white blouse and it was rule that we had to have it buttoned all the way up to the top. This wasn't very comfortable because the blouse keeps coming out of the pinafore from the sides, whenever any big movements were made. We had to wear this everyday, besides gym class days. </span>

  	<span class="sacpopuptext2" id="myPopupsac2"> The name tag - I think it is just a Singaporean thing to parade around with a badge with your name on it. If one is caught without a name tag, they will get in trouble. </span>

<button class="sacpopup3" onclick="sacFunction3()"> 
  	<span class="sacpopuptext3" id="myPopupsac3"> When I was in Grade 4 to 6, I was a prefect (let's just say it was an equivalent to a student leader). Prefects had to wear this clip-on tie and an extra badge that says "prefect". Funny enough, this was my favourite part of the uniform. </span>

<button class="sacpopup4" onclick="sacFunction4()"> 
  	<span class="sacpopuptext4" id="myPopupsac4"> The rule was to wear white over-the-ankle socks and white shoes. It was very hard to keep these shoes clean because young kids like us were prone to running around and jumping into muddy fields during recess. </span>
