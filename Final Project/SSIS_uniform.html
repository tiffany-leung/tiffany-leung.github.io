<button class="ssispopup" onclick="ssisFunction()"> 
  	<span class="ssispopuptext" id="myPopupssis"> I feel that the concept for this uniform is good, but the cutting the manufacturing of it is terrible. We had both summer and winter uniforms and they fit terribly - not to mention they were overpriced. </span>
	</button>

<button class="ssispopup2" onclick="ssisFunction2()"> 
  	<span class="ssispopuptext2" id="myPopupssis2"> This white buttoned down was part of the "formal uniform" that we had to wear everyday. If this was not tucked into the skirt/pants - I would get into trouble. </span>
	</button>

<button class="ssispopup3" onclick="ssisFunction3()"> 
  	<span class="ssispopuptext3" id="myPopupssis3"> All girls had to wear this red checkered skirt. Good girls follow the rules and keep the skirt length reaching the knee, while the rest of us either alter it or roll it up to make it shorter.  </span>
	</button>

<button class="ssispopup4" onclick="ssisFunction4()"> 
  	<span class="ssispopuptext4" id="myPopupssis4"> Wearing this uniform made me learn how to tie a tie. We had to wear this school tie everyday, if not we will get into major trouble - and that happened to me once and I almost screamed back at the disciplined master "THIS IS DUMB".  </span>
	</button>

<button class="ssispopup5" onclick="ssisFunction5()"> 
  	<span class="ssispopuptext5" id="myPopupssis5"> The vest- came in long sleeves (for winter) and sleeveless (just coz). I think the vest made the uniform look worse so I always avoided wearing it...unless I had to. </span>
	</button>

<button class="ssispopup6" onclick="ssisFunction6()"> 
  	<span class="ssispopuptext6" id="myPopupssis6"> It was the Japanese girls who started the trend of wearing knee-high black socks during the winter, and everyone else followed suit. I mean it was the cutest look in this whole uniform. </span>
