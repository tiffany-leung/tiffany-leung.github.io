	<p> I used to hate uniforms. I felt that uniforms were boring, ugly and unnecessary rules that we have to follow. They said "keep yourself tidy in your uniform because it gives the school a better image" - what load of bullshit. I remember that I got so tired and bored by what I had to wear everyday, and then get reprimmanded by some uptight asshole of a teacher whenever you break a uniform rule or 2. Even though these uniforms were still and scratchy, I look back and see significant stages of my life. I see the different schools that I went to and also my growth as the sizes increase. They used to be something so dreadful to me, but now, they finally have meaning.</p>
