<button class="HKpopup" onclick="HKFunction()"> What about Hong Kong? <span class="HKpopuptext" id="PopupHK"> Hong Kong can be considered as my 4th home, even when I have never lived there.

<button class="USpopup" onclick="USFunction()"> How about the US? <span class="USpopuptext" id="PopupUS"> When I first got the States, I was really confused about all these coins and their values. Once, I even had to get help from the lady at the cash register to pick out the amount I had to pay. Now, I am slowing integrating into the New York society; yet, I have so much more to explore. </span>
