<p> Even though she wasn't in my class, I quickly knew who she was because she was known as the girl with the "funny accent", and as cruel as second graders could be, they sort of made fun of her by mimicking it. This also brought me back to the time when I became friends with a blonde English girl in second grade, and also these 2 American sisters who came to my school in the following years. These girls did not have friends, and I remembered one of the American girls being viciously bullied by others because of her distinctly foreign accent, and also her tremendous love for horses. My eight and nine-year-old self, however, did not think that this sort of segregation was a problem. I was accepted by everyone else because I look the same and talk the same; I <em> couldn't comprehend </em> their pain. </p>
