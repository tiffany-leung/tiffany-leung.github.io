<h1> There is <em>nothing wrong</em> with my accent </h1>
	<h2> <em> part i </em> </h2> 

<p> It was during the first 2 weeks of classes in my Sophomore year; I met a girl in one of my classes, and surprisingly she is an American who has lived in Singapore for a long period of time. She told me that instead of studying in an international school, she went to a local school and didn't really enjoy the experience. One of the reasons was because she was set apart as being different - white and speaks in an American accent. This triggered a memory of mine - in second grade, a girl transferred from the US to my school (<a href="http://stanthonyscanossianpri.moe.edu.sg/">
a local girls' school in Singapore</a>). </p>
