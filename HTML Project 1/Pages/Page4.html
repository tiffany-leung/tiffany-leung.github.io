<p> I spent 6 years of my secondary education in international schools and also studying in the US right now. There is no doubt that I have picked up a very distinctly foreign (or some people label it as <em>"ang mor"</em>) accent; it is even very difficult for me to go back to my original Singaporean accent. <em>But I am <strong> NOT </strong> being fake.</em> Some people might say, "If you are really Singaporean, you should speak in a Singaporean accent", and I can rebuttal that with, "If you are really Chinese, you should speak Mandarin in the classic Chinese accent" . <em> Wouldn't that be fair? </em>  </p>
