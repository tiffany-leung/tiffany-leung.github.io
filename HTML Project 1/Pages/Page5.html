<p> I am very blessed that the Singaporeans I know (or well, that I know of) are very accepting of me for being who I am and how I speak. I am glad that people do not make fun of me or label me as being a "pretentious caucasian wannabe"; I am also pretty sure that there a lot of people who are just as equally blessed as I am. I speak of this, because I am here to speak for fellow Singaporeans who speak in a foreign accent and got stigmatised. And for those who fake it, <em> just be who you are.</em> </p>
