	<h1> There is <em> nothing wrong </em> with my accent </h1>
	<h2> <em> part iii </em> </h2> 

<p> If I say that there is <em> no racism </em> in Singapore and people of all races are accepted equally,</p>
<p id="special"> I am very wrong.</p>
<p> Then again, even if it is not about race, there is actually a stigma on Asians with foreign or "white" accents. They are usually assumed as "fake", and that these people are labelled as "pretentious" or "white people wannabes". Indeed, those pretentious people do exist, but how about Singaporeans who grew up overseas or have studied abroad for more than a few years of their life? Sure, there are people who don't pick up the foreign accent and they are not stigmatised. While others who did, are.  </p>
