    <h1> How Disney’s 1942 Film Bambi Came to Be Influenced by the Lush Landscapes of the Sung Dynasty </h1>
    <h2> Chinese-American Artist Tyrus Wong's Brush With Destiny </h2>
    <h3> by Joann Stevens </h3>
    <p> Pamela Tom, a documentary filmmaker, says she is still thankful for the chance encounter 14 years ago that led her to the now 103-year-old Chinese American artist Tyrus Wong.
    </p>
    <p> She first heard his name in a short film included with the Disney home video Bambi that Tom watched with her young daughter about the making of the 1942 classic. Wong wasn’t interviewed in the film, but the other animators spoke of his work with such admiration that Tom knew she had to find and tell the artist’s story. She successfully tracked him down in 1998, locating the playful Wong in Los Angeles trying to teach goldfish in his pond to eat at the sound of a bell, and building kites and flying them off the Santa Monica pier. </p>
