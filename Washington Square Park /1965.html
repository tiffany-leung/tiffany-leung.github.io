      <h2> Life in the 1960s </h2>
      <p>
        The 1960s was the age of the youth and change. Children born in the Baby
        Boom Era have grown up, living in a society that has moved on from the
        times of WWII. The large population of youths in the United States
        changed the direction of design and visual culture, as well as the emergence
        of Rock and Roll and new social movements. Besides the movements for "sex, drugs
        and rock & roll", the 60s was also the decade of change. The African Americans
        pushed for equality in the Civil Rights Movement, and women also started fighting
        for equal pay and opportunities in the work force. Some protests also went into
        international matters, such as the protests against the war in Vietnam. Therefore
        the 60s was remembered as the turning point for America - the time when society
        started being different.
