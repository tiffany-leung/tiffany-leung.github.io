      <h2> Life in the 1930s </h2>
      <p>
        It was during the 1930s when the world fell into the Great Depression.
        Ever since the Depression hit the world in 1929, the state of New York's financial
        world collapsed. There was unemployment that led to poverty, and the rise of
        homelessness in the city. Areas called "Hoovervilles" were set up - make shift
        shacks made up with scraps of materials found lying around were built by the
        homeless. But even during this time of financial hardship, New York City's wealthy class
        continued to flaunt their wealth, and it was during this time when the most iconic buildings
        of New York were built (The Empire State & Chrysler Building). Because of the Great Depression,
        artists and musicians were given the chance to display the talent and craft in Washington Square
        Park to get extra tips for their living expenses. So it was during the 1930s when the culture of
        musicians and artists performing showcasing their trade started and it continues till the present
        day.
