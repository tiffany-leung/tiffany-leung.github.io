      <h2> Life in the 1970s </h2>
      <p>
        In some ways the 1970s was a continuation of the 1960s, or even
        more tumultuous. People such as Women, African Americans, Gays, Lesbians
        and marginalized people contiuned to fight for equality. Ongoing protests
        against the War in Vietnam continued to happen, until the war ended in
        1974. A “New Right” mobilized in defense of political conservatism and traditional family roles,
        and the behavior of President Richard Nixon undermined many people’s
        faith in the good intentions of the federal government. The Environmental
        Movement flourished in this decade, when people started caring about
        protecting the environment from toxic industrial wastes and meltdowns
        at nuclear power plants. Americans celebrated the first Earth Day in 1970,
        and the Congressed passed the National Environmental Policy act in the same year.
