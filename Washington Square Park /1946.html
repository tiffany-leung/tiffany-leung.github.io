      <h2> Life in the 1940s </h2>
      <p>
        This is the time when the world just came out of the trauma of WWII.
        After WWII officially ended in 1945, the war had left countries in states
        of devastation. Cities and towns were destroyed into rubble, and populations
        were massacred. Fortunately, the United States was not one of those countries
        that had to suffer much loss. However, this war had lost them a lot of young men
        who enlisted into the United States army at their youth. The returning veterans
        were given jobs and college educations under the G.I. Bill, but as much as the
        United States goverment tried to help the veterans ease back into society like
        before, a lot of them suffered from PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) or were unable
        to return to their previous lives.
